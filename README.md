# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# domeland_nft_contract" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/DOMELAND/domeland_nft_contract.git
git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/DOMELAND/domeland_nft_contract.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

…or import code from another repository
You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
